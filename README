ActsAsChanged
=============

Make an ActiveRecord model keep track of it's original attributes so that changes can be detected,
and partial saves, dirty-flag detection and other change-driven algorithms are possible.

Many new methods are added to ActiveRecord::Base related to changed attributes, and even few additional goodies.
All of the callbacks still work, etc.

The only core ActiveRecord::Base behaviour which is *automatically* changed by this plugin is the
update_attribute and update_attributes methods (see below).

Only one option is supported by the acts_as_changed method:

::update_changes:: true / false

If this option evaluates to true, update_attribute(s) and friends will update any changed attributes.
Otherwise, by default, they will update each of the specified attribute(s).
